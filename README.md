# ml-from-scratch-for-images

**Machine learning from scratch:**
- Implement machine learning methods from scratch in Python, using IRIS and MNIST datasets.
- Cover line fitting, PCA, k-means, linear classification, logistic regression, SVMs, and Neural Networks.
- Focus on understanding the algorithms deeply and document your code for learning purposes.
- Visualize results to enhance comprehension.

**Machine learning for images:**
- Use Celeb dataset to generate images with autoencoders.
- Experiment with Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) and different loss functions.
- Explore data augmentation and transfer learning for better results.
- Document training process and visualize generated images and loss curves.
